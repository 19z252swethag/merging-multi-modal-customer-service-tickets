Merging multi modal customer service tickets

## Problem statement
Solving customer issues is now a part of any organization offering its products or services. Customers reach out to companies by opening a ticket with their email or phone number and describing their issue. They contact the customer service via multiple channels. Oftentimes, customers reach out to customer service with the same issue, but under different email ids, phone numbers and accounts. Merging such tickets makes it efficient to address them correctly and in least amount of time. Our problem statement is to merge relevant tickets of a user to efficiently handle customer issues.
